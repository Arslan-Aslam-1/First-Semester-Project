# First-Semester-Project
This C++ program implements an Online Voting System where users can register, log in, and cast votes for candidates based on their province. The system ensures secure and fair voting by enforcing unique voter IDs and restricting users to vote only once.

Functionality & Uses:
User Registration: Voters must register with a unique 5-digit ID, password, and select their province.
Login System: Users log in using their registered credentials.
Voting Process: Each voter can vote for one candidate from their province (Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, KPK).
Vote Counting: The system keeps track of votes per candidate and province.
Record Checking: Voters can check their voting history.
Displaying Results: The system displays the number of votes per candidate and determines the winner in each province.
